# Project 1
- Data was collected using the GitHub API, focusing on Dublin-based users with a follower count above 50, and analyzed based on their recent repositories.
- Dublin developers predominantly use JavaScript, but MDX repositories surprisingly receive the highest average stars, revealing strong interest in markdown-based and content-focused projects.
- To maximize community engagement, Dublin developers could consider open-sourcing their work in high-interest areas like JavaScript and explore MDX for documentation-focused initiatives.

The repository contains the Users and Repositories data in separate .csv files, along with the code used for data scraping. The analysis can be viewed in the included .ipynb file.
